I was bored and tried to watch tv serial in my computer from my bed. But couldn't play/pause the video when I needed. I don't have a wireless thingy to control it so I built a simple and no-brainer one.

> Disclaimer: Don't take this project seriously :P. It's tested on default video player on Ubuntu (16.04). Your video player must be on focus. 


If you want to give it a try:
1. Clone the rep.
2. Run `npm install` from the cloned repo
3. Run `npm start`

> The above program will print an IP to your console.

For the Android client do the following:
1. Put the IP address you got from the console in the app.
2. Tap on toggle button to play/pause the video on your Ubuntu/(Any video player that play/pause on space tap) machine.

**Enjoy**
